[h1]Information[/h1]
Current version: 2.2.0
This mod aims to make fishing a greater and overall faster experience for the player. 
Right now the only modification of this mod is a multilure system but more features are being developed.

The mod at a [u]beta[/u] state, meaning that some features may change in the future and not all content is completly integrated.

[h1]Features[/h1]
[b]Multilure[/b]
There is a complex multilure system that allows for each rod to throw lures depending on some conditions.
Due to how this system was approached before I decided to add a configuration so you can revert the system to the older implementation.

To give a description of what does each implementation:
[list]
 [*][u]SIMPLE[/u] There are no conditions or complexity for the multilure system, each rod has its own amount of lures to throw.
 [*][u]NORMAL[/u] The amount of lures for each rod can depend on complex conditions, such as biome, height, health, mana etc...
 [*][u]DISABLED[/u] If you dont like the multilure feature, you can disable it completly.
[/list]

[b]More features on future releases[/b]
[code]If you have any suggestion or idea of any feature that could look cool for the mod, let me know in the comment section ;)[/code]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
There are no known incompatibilities.

All Vanilla rods have their own implementation
All Calamity rods have their own implementation

[code]My goal in terms of compatibility is that the mod should be compatible with any other mod worldwide and must not break functionallity of other mods.
If there is any known incompatibility I will explictly work to fix it or at least notify the users about it[/code]
