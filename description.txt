Features
	MULTILURE
	There is a complex multilure system that allows for each rod to throw lures depending on some conditions.
	Due to how this system was approached before I decided to add a configuration so you can revert the system to the older implementation.

	To give a description of what does each implementation:
	- SIMPLE: There are no conditions or complexity for the multilure system, each rod has its own amount of lures to throw.
	- NORMAL: The amount of lures for each rod can depend on complex conditions, such as biome, height, health, mana etc...
	- DISABLED: If you dont like the multilure feature, you can disable it completly.

	More features on future releases
	If you have any suggestion or idea of any feature that could look cool for the mod, let me know in the comment section ;)
