This mod allows to throw multiple fishing lines at the same time, thus consuming more bait.

I may add more content to the mod as I receive feedback :), so if you wish to see other features, such as accesories, mechanics, baits or any other, post a comment with the suggested changed!

  Features
Adds lures to each rod depending on the rarity of the rod
Multiplier to change the amount of lures

  Compatibilities
  The mod will work with any rod from any mod, however, the following mods have been explicitly modified (thus, being full compatible)
- Calamity mod
