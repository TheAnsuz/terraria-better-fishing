## Better fishing

A Terraria (tmodloader) mod that aims to improve the fishing experience by making it greater, extensive and overall faster.

The mod features are listed below, however, the mod is currently at a beta stage, meaning that **features are planned but not implemented** or in-progress and **existing features are subject to change**

## Features:  
* Multilure
* Angler shop
* Easy quest system

Versions prior to `2.1.1` wont be posted in the repository as there was no repository for them (and later, there was a repository conversion and decided to remove the old history of the mod)
